Pre-requisites:

Java 8
Microsoft SQL Server (for the database) - connection details would need to be updated in DBWorker.java

To run the system, use the executable JAR file
java -jar coursespotter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

If this does not work, the system can just be compiled and then ran.

Compile
--
The easiest way is to use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. 
The package manager Maven should be able to download all of the dependencies automatically.
Compilation will be easier this way.

Once ran, the system can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/ or http://127.0.0.1:8080/
